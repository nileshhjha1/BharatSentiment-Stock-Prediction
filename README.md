## ✨ Features

*   **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Combines three distinct data sources for robust predictions.
    *   **Technical Analysis**: Utilizes LSTM neural networks on historical price data and indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands).
    *   **Sentiment Analysis**: Employs a pre-trained `distilbert` model from Hugging Face to analyze news headlines for market sentiment.
    *   **Fundamental Analysis**: Incorporates key valuation metrics like P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, and Market Cap.
*   **Fusion AI Model**: A `RandomForestClassifier` that intelligently weights the predictions from each modality (Technical, Sentiment, Fundamental) to generate a final bull/bear probability.
*   **Interactive Dashboard**: A beautiful, responsive Streamlit web app with interactive Plotly charts for visual analysis.
*   **Real-time Data**: Fetches live stock data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`).
*   **News Integration**: Can pull real news headlines using the NewsAPI (with a provided key) or uses a realistic simulator for demonstration.

**Data Flow**:
1.  **Data Acquisition**: `yfinance` → OHLCV + Fundamentals → Technical Indicators calculated.
2.  **Technical Model**: Prepared data fed into an LSTM network for price trend prediction.
3.  **Sentiment Model**: News headlines are processed by a transformer model for sentiment scores.
4.  **Fusion Model**: Technical prediction, sentiment scores, and fundamental data are features for a final classifier.
5.  **Visualization**: Results are displayed via Plotly charts in the Streamlit UI.
